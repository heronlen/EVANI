convert to json can you add both pdf's to the one json, i know the fields arent the same, to help with that use the data fields in Economy 7 Price Comparison Table pdf as the master, from Electricity Price Comparison Table pdf remove the column annual cost, put zero in the column for NIGHT UNIT RATE PENCE PER UNIT/KWH and change the field PRICE IN PENCE PER UNIT/KWH to match be in DAY UNIT RATE PENCE PER UNIT/KWH.  Also remove the p beside all charges
